            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
                Tierra is built as a FREE app.
                This app is provided by the developer at no cost and is intended for use as is.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to
                the collection and use of information in relation to this
                policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with
                anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <h3>Collection and Use</h3>
            <p>
                For a better experience, while using our Service, a plant name and photo are required. The information that
                I request will be retained on your device and your iCloud and is not collected by me in any way.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app does not collect real information from you.
                All information required by Tierra is a name of your plants and an image for the plant.
            </p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                stored on your device's internal memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Service does not use these “cookies”.
            </p>
            <h3>Service Providers</h3>
            <p>
                No service providers are used besides Apple's iCloud.
                More information on iCloud can be found on Apple's website here: <a href="https://www.apple.com/icloud/"
                    target="_blank" rel="apple iCloud">apple/iCloud</a>
            </p>
            <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
            <p>
                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                I do not knowingly collect personally
                identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                me with personal information, I immediately
                delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
                and you are aware that your child has provided us with
                personal information, please contact me so that
                I will be able to do necessary actions.
            </p>
            <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
                I may update our Privacy Policy from
                time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                periodically for any changes. I will
                notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
                this page.
            </p>
            <p>This policy is effective as of 2020-06-19</p>
